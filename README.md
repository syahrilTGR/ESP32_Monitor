# esp32_monitor

A Flutter application for monitoring dummy sensor data from an ESP32 device via Bluetooth and WebSocket.

## Overview

This project consists of:
- **Flutter mobile app**: Connects to ESP32 via Bluetooth Classic, sends WiFi credentials, requests IP address, and receives real-time sensor data via WebSocket.
- **ESP32 firmware**: Receives WiFi credentials via Bluetooth, connects to WiFi, starts a WebSocket server, and sends dummy sensor data (location, temperature, emergency status).

### Main Features

- Scan and connect to ESP32 via Bluetooth.
- Send WiFi SSID and password to ESP32.
- Request ESP32 IP address.
- Remotely reset ESP32.
- Display ESP32 WiFi connection status.
- Show/hide password input for convenience.
- Display real-time sensor data from ESP32 via WebSocket.

### How It Works

1. **Bluetooth**:  
   - The app connects to ESP32 and sends WiFi credentials.
   - ESP32 connects to WiFi and replies with connection status and IP address.
2. **WebSocket**:  
   - The app connects to ESP32's WebSocket server using the received IP address.
   - ESP32 sends dummy sensor data periodically.

### ESP32 Dummy Data

- Latitude & Longitude (randomized Â±100m)
- Environment temperature
- Body temperature
- Emergency status (random)
- Timestamp

## ESP32 Dummy Firmware

The ESP32 source code (dummy WiFi + Bluetooth + WebSocket) can be found in this repository:
